- 👋 Hello my name is Jose Quintero, I am a Frontend Developer. I love web design and programming, I created this github account because I want to upload the code of my projects and contribute to the community. I love coffee, pizza and be organized. 
- 👀 I'm interested in everything related to CSS(sass), atomic design, ui and ux design. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and doing projects to improve my skills. Then I will continue with React/Vue, Nodejs and NPM.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which focus on interface design or development.
