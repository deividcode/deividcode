- 👋 hello my name is jose quintero (@deividcode), I am a frontend developer. I love web design and programming, I created this github account because I want to upload the code of my projects and contribute to the community. I love coffee, pizza and I use the podomoro model. 
- 👀 I'm interested in everything related to CSS(sass), atomic design, ui and ux design. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and doing projects to improve my skills. Then I will continue with React, Nodejs and NPM.
